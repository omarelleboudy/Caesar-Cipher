# Caesar Cipher
My own take on the Caesar Cipher, with the app having the ability to both Encrypt and Decrypt.

# Techonlogy used
.NET 6, but the code can run on older and newer versions of .NET.

# What is Caesar Cipher?
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# Project Contents
This project is my take on the cipher. It is capable of the following:
- Shifting lowercase English Alphabet Letters.
- Shifting Uppercase English Alphabet Letters.
- Shifting Digits between 0 and 9.
- It can both Encrypt and Decrypt a string.

# Code
- Inside the project, you will file a Program.cs file. That file is your entry point.
- In a folder called Shifters, you will find a folder that contains the abstraction for the shifter classes, and all 3 shifter classes for each type of character.
